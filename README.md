This package allows the use of color palettes in R and ggplot2 based on official UCSF Brand Identity color palettes. The official colors and guidelines are described at https://identity.ucsf.edu/brand-guide/print-colors and https://identity.ucsf.edu/brand-guide/digital-colors.

## Colors
- The base colors are named navy, teal, green, blue, orange.
- Accent colors are purple, red, yellow.
- Each color has 3 lighter tints, a 70\%, 40\%, and 10\% tint of the main color. These are names based on the main color, appended with a 3, 2, or 1, respectively. For example, full strength is called "blue", the 70\% tint is "blue3", the 40\% tint
#' is "blue2", and the 10\% tint is "blue1"

## Developement
This package is under active development. I have tested with ggplot 3.0, and appreciate any feedback. Continuing to test and will flesh out the documentation.
